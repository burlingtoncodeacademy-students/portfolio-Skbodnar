              I balance an aspirational vision for whatâ€™s possible with rigorous
              attention for how we continue to reach that potential. <br />
              <br />
              My background in storytelling, community-based advocacy, and
              leadership development has shaped my motivation to use tech to create conditions for people to live authentically with agency and dignity.
